"""Write a short Python script, that takes two numbers values, where one of them is
the hours worked by employee and the other is the rate, the equation to calculate
the payment is (hours * rate), but if the hours is more than 40 the equation is
(hours * rate + (hours - 40) * rate * 0.5). So we need a script to do this automatically."""
